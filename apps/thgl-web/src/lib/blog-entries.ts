      "After years of building TH.GL solo, the web components source code is now available on GitHub. Here's what's open, what's not, and how you can contribute — especially with AI tools like Claude Code.",
    date: "2025-10-02",
    content: `
Over the past few years, I've been asked countless times: **"How does the map work?"**, **"Can I see the code?"**, or **"How do you handle X feature?"**

Today, I'm happy to share that the answer is now: **Yes — go look for yourself!**

## 🔓 The Code Is Now Public

The **TH.GL web components** monorepo is now available on GitHub:

👉 [**github.com/The-Hidden-Gaming-Lair/thgl-web-components**](https://github.com/The-Hidden-Gaming-Lair/thgl-web-components)

This includes:
- 🌐 All game-specific **web apps** (palworld.th.gl, duneawakening.th.gl, etc.)
- 🎮 All **Overwolf apps** (in-game overlays)
- 📦 Shared **UI components** and **libraries**
- ⚙️ Build configs, CI/CD workflows, and tooling

It's the full frontend codebase — everything that powers the maps, filters, overlays, and interactive features you use every day.

## 🤔 Why Now?

I've been building TH.GL solo for years, and it's grown way beyond what I imagined.

But I've reached a point where **I can't handle all the requests and suggestions on my own anymore**.

There are dozens of feature requests, bug reports, and small improvements sitting on the [**suggestions-issues page**](https://www.th.gl/suggestions-issues) — many of which I'd love to implement, but simply don't have the time for.

By opening the code, I'm hoping the community can help out. Whether it's fixing a bug, adding a feature, improving documentation, or even translating the UI — **all contributions are welcome**.

## 📖 What's Open (and What's Not)

### ✅ What's Public:
- **thgl-web-components** — all web apps, Overwolf apps, shared UI/libraries
- Full access to the codebase, issues, pull requests, and discussions

### 🔒 What's Still Private:
- **Data mining tools** (extracting game data from files)
- **Memory reading tools** (real-time position tracking)
- **Companion app internals** (Windows desktop app)

These stay private for security, anti-cheat, and licensing reasons.

## ⚖️ The License: What You Can (and Can't) Do

The code is **source-available, but NOT open source**.

**You CAN:**
- ✅ Read and explore the code
- ✅ Submit pull requests with improvements
- ✅ Learn from the code and use it as a reference
- ✅ Report issues and suggest features

**You CANNOT:**
- ❌ Deploy your own version of TH.GL (with or without ads)
- ❌ Reuse the code for your own projects
- ❌ Fork it to build competing services

Think of it as **"view and contribute only"** — not a free-for-all.

All rights remain reserved. If you're interested in forking or licensing the code for something else, reach out to me directly.

## 🤖 Contributing with AI — It's Easier Than Ever

Here's the thing: contributing to open codebases used to require deep familiarity with the project.

But now, with **AI tools like Claude Code**, you can jump in much faster.

I've included a **[CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/The-Hidden-Gaming-Lair/thgl-web-components/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)** file in the repo that provides context for AI assistants — so if you're using Claude Code (or similar tools), it can help you:
- Understand the project structure
- Navigate the monorepo
- Suggest fixes or improvements
- Write code that matches the existing style

Even if you're not an expert in React, Next.js, or TurboRepo — AI can help bridge the gap.

**Want to try?** Check out the [**README.md**](https://github.com/The-Hidden-Gaming-Lair/thgl-web-components/blob/main/README.md), let Claude (or your AI tool of choice) read the [**CLAUDE.md**](https://github.com/The-Hidden-Gaming-Lair/thgl-web-components/blob/main/CLAUDE.md), and start exploring.

## 🛠️ A Few Technical Notes

### The Monorepo
The codebase is organized as a **TurboRepo monorepo** — each game has its own web app and Overwolf app, with shared packages for UI components and logic.

It's grown organically over the years, and honestly, **I wouldn't structure it this way if I started fresh today**. But it works, and it's what we have.

### High-Performance Maps
The current maps are built on **Leaflet** and optimized for performance — even with thousands of markers.

But I'm also working on a **modern replacement with WebGL2 support** (check out the **feat/thgl-map** branch if you're curious). The new renderer will support:
- 🔄 **Map rotation**
- 🎯 **Perspective changes**
- ✨ **Smoother controls and interactions**

It's still experimental, but it's coming.

## 💬 Where to Contribute

Not sure where to start? Here are some ideas:

1. **Check the [suggestions-issues page](https://www.th.gl/suggestions-issues)** — these are community requests pulled from Discord
2. **Improve documentation** — add comments, write guides, clarify configs
3. **Fix bugs** — test the apps and submit fixes
4. **Add translations** — help localize the UI for other languages

If you want to discuss contributions or get help, join the [**Discord**](https://th.gl/discord) — I'm active there and happy to guide new contributors.

## 🙏 Thank You

Building TH.GL has been an incredible journey, and I'm excited to see what happens now that the code is open.

    title: "How We Fixed the Overlay Input Freeze in the THGL Companion App",
    description:
      "Some users reported that the THGL overlay stopped responding after a few minutes — while hotkeys still worked. After days of debugging and community testing, the cause and a permanent fix are finally here.",
    date: "2025-09-12",
    content: `
## 🧩 The Issue

After releasing the rewritten **THGL Companion App**, some users began reporting that the overlay would **stop responding to clicks** after a few minutes — even though:

- Hotkeys still worked perfectly  
- The map was still updating in real time  
- Restarting sometimes helped, but only for a few minutes

Interestingly, this problem **wasn’t universal**:  
- It happened frequently for some users while playing **Dune Awakening**  
- Others only saw it in **Palia**  
- Most players never experienced it at all

This made it *very* hard to reproduce and fix.

## 🕵️ What We Discovered

The overlay depends on low-level mouse input events from \`WM_INPUT\`.  
However, these messages are posted to the same message queue as everything else in the overlay — including rendering, UI logic, and other work.

If the overlay process gets **slightly overloaded** (for example while rendering large map updates), the message queue can start backing up.  
Once it fills up far enough, **\`WM_INPUT\` stops being dispatched entirely**, even though the rest of the app keeps running.

This explains:

- Why it happened more often in heavier games like **Dune Awakening**  
- Why it sometimes showed up in lighter games like **Palia**  
- Why it never happened at all on faster PCs  
- Why the freeze didn’t occur immediately — the backlog slowly built up

## ⚡ The Fix

The solution was to **move input handling into its own dedicated thread**.

- The input thread now receives all \`WM_INPUT\` events directly  
- It forwards them to the overlay window using \`PostMessage\`  
- This keeps input processing smooth and isolated from heavy rendering work

Since implementing this, testers have reported **no further freezes** — even after hours of use.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Don’t run time-critical input logic on the same thread as rendering/UI  
- \`WM_INPUT\` can silently stop arriving if the main queue is congested  
- Having a community willing to test builds is *invaluable* 🧡

## 📦 THGL Companion App Rewrite

This fix shipped as part of the larger rewrite of the [**THGL Companion App**](https://www.th.gl/companion-app):

- 🧠 No more game injection (safer, more stable)  
- 🎯 Much lower memory usage and CPU load  
- 🗺️ Support for new games like **Dune Awakening**  
- 🐛 Fixes for various issues (like missing fish locations and weekly wants)

If you’re happy with the **Overwolf** version, you can keep using it —  
but if you want the new architecture and fixes, try the Companion App!

    title: "Why I Created a Standalone Companion App After 10+ Overwolf Apps",
    description:
      "After years of developing Overwolf apps, I built the TH.GL Companion App to be lighter, faster, and more flexible — with overlays, live maps, and tracking tools outside of Overwolf.",
    content: `
In 2016, I built my first Overwolf app during the **League of Legends Overwolf Dev Challenge** — and won it with *Trophy Hunter*, an achievement tracker for LoL. That experience kicked off my journey into building tools for gamers.

Since then, I’ve developed more than 10 Overwolf apps for games like **New World**, **Palworld**, **Once Human**, **Infinity Nikki**, and many others.

But in 2025, I launched something entirely new: the **TH.GL Companion App** — a standalone application, independent from Overwolf.

### Overwolf Was a Great Start

Overwolf gave me the tools I needed:
- A strong API for overlays, hotkeys, and in-game data
- Automatic updates and app store visibility
- A way to focus on app development, not deployment infrastructure

It worked well for many years, especially while I was building these tools alongside a full-time job.

### Why I Built My Own

Over time, I began hearing requests for a more lightweight solution. Some users wanted a version of the tools **without extra background services**, installations, or performance overhead.

There were also challenges on the development side. Occasionally, I had to delay updates because of Overwolf platform issues like:
- Missing support for certain games or DX versions
- Crashes and performance issues that weren’t under my control

Eventually, I decided I wanted to try building my own system — one that would give me more control, flexibility, and fewer dependencies.

![Palworld Overlay](/images/overlay-palworld.webp)

### What’s Inside the Companion App

The TH.GL Companion App offers:
- Overlay + second-screen toggle
- Real-time player tracking
- Support for multiple games, including **Palworld**, **Once Human**, **Infinity Nikki**, and more

All without needing to install or run Overwolf.

![App Launcher](/images/app-launcher.webp)

### The Benefits

By moving away from Overwolf, I can:
- Push updates and support new games much faster
- Avoid waiting for platform fixes
- Deliver a smoother experience with fewer restrictions
- Keep everything lightweight and performance-focused

Plus, it’s been a great learning experience — diving into DX injection, overlay rendering, and everything required to build an app like this from scratch.

### How’s It Going?

The Companion App is still new, but I’ve already seen **hundreds of daily users**, even with a soft launch. It’s far from done, but the core functionality is solid, and I’m updating it regularly based on feedback.

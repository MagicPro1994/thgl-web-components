# 2.0.2

This release is a rewrite of most of the existing features. The main reason is to add support for games like Dune Awakening, which have a different architecture and require a more flexible approach. The app is not injecting into the game process anymore, which improves compatibility and stability.
Most of the app crashes should be resolved with this update. In addition, it's easier for me to support future game updates, which would break the position tracking before.

Because of this major change, there could be some new issues introduced. If you encounter any problems, please report them so I can address them quickly.
Overall, I'm very happy with this update and the app feels more stable and the performance is improved.

Other changes include:

- Feat: Add position detection support for Dune Awakening (currently in preview access for Elite Supporter only)
- Feat: Improve crash logging
- Remove: Drop support for Infinity Nikki. This game is more difficult to update and the numbers are very low compared to other games. Sadly, it's not worth the effort.
- Remove: Support for exclusive full-screen mode. Please play the games in borderless or windowed mode.
- Fix: Close all app windows on game exit
- Fix: All game crashes
